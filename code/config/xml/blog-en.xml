<ol>
<li>
<h4>What would be your first steps in starting SEO for a newly launched e-commerce site?</h4>
<p>I would first want to think about my overall marketing and unique value proposition. The days when SEO could be achieved by a business or website without something unique that made them truly stand out to the web are over. Today, if you want to perform well in search rankings over the long haul, you need to be remarkable in a way that makes those who see your shop want to share, write about you, and recommend you to others. Establishing that true uniqueness is incredibly challenging, but with billions of people performing billions of searches and only a few top ranking positions for any given set of keywords, competition is naturally going to be intense.</li>
<p><span id="more-17656"></span></p>
<li>
<h4>Do you think every e-commerce site needs a blog?</h4>
<p>No, certainly not. Unless your passion is writing and you can create a remarkable blog that people will want to read and share, I&#8217;d do something else. Find that area of contribution to your site (and your business) where your skills can shine and you can be better than 99% of your competitors and do that. It could be photography or design or video or interactive elements. Perhaps it&#8217;s in-depth guides or how-tos. Maybe you can produce animations or illustrations that perfectly capture your products&#8217; value. Blogs are a popular way to share content, but not every piece of content that you might be uniquely good at is best suited to a blog.</li>
<li>
<h4>What do you think are the most important factors in getting product pages to rank high in search engines.</h4>
<p>&#8212; A powerful domain that many people are linking to and using<br />
&#8212;Individual pages that have lots of editorially-given links and usage data associated with them<br />
&#8212;Keyword targeting that matches what the searcher has typed in<br />
&#8212; A page experience that not only fulfills the searcher&#8217;s needs, but goes beyond utility to provide enjoyment, surprise, and delight as well (this is what the few stores that are able to outrank giants like Amazon have been able to do)<br />
&#8212;A bot-friendly internal link/crawl structure and URL system &#8211; every unique item/category/piece of content has only a single, static, readable, canonical URL<br />
&#8212;Schema markup is a good way to stand out in the SERPs &#8211; there are a <a href="http://searchengineland.com/e-commerce-seo-using-schema-org-just-got-a-lot-more-granular-139236" target="_blank">ton of options listed here</a>.</li>
<li>
<h4>Do you have any suggestions for drop shippers that use a product feed with no unique descriptions?</h4>
<p>If you offer no unique value beyond the availability of the same product many others are offering, you don&#8217;t deserve to rank well. Historically, you could be in an undeserving position and still leverage SEO to rank, but those days are over. My suggestion would be not to expect to rank well for pages where you&#8217;re not providing an experience dramatically better than everyone else in the top 20 results &#8211; that includes unique descriptions (although that&#8217;s the most basic of the required elements).</li>
<li>
<h4>How would you go about link building for an e-commerce site?</h4>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of success from e-commerce stores that are very press-worthy and get the attention of media and blogs. My focus would be on designing an experience, a collection of products, and a style that&#8217;s unique and media-worthy. Some good places to get inspiration are the sites showing off unique ecommerce designs. Check out, for example: <a href="http://www.awwwards.com/20-of-the-very-best-e-commerce-web-sites.html" target="_blank">Awwwards</a>, <a href="http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2010/01/22/35-beautiful-and-effective-ecommerce-websites/" target="_blank">Smashing Magazine</a> and <a href="http://engage.synecoretech.com/marketing-technology-for-growth/bid/177023/10-Awesome-Examples-of-Ecommerce-Sites-Using-Responsive-Web-Design" target="_blank">Synecore</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have that media-worthiness in your design and focus, I&#8217;d seek to produce content that helps show off what makes the site unique. Betabrand, for example, focuses on sharing <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/2/20/5430460/move-fast-and-sew-things-how-betabrand-turns-crazy-ideas-into-real-stuff">how their dress yoga pants can provide comfort</a> in professional settings</li>
<li>
<h4>What are &#8220;local citations&#8221;? Do you think they are important for e-commerce sites that sell to a whole country, several countries, or even worldwide?</h4>
<p>Local citations are generally more geared toward the local listings (those that show up in Google&#8217;s &#8220;maps&#8221; style results). If you&#8217;re marketing nationally or globally and don&#8217;t have physical storefronts, these are less important (though anyone mentioning or talking about you online is a good thing).</li>
<li>
<h4>When an e-commerce website has product pages for products that will never be in stock again, how would you handle them for SEO? Remove the page? Leave the pages up with an Out of Stock message? Redirect the page to other products or something else?</h4>
<p>I like to do one of two things &#8211; either redirect the page using a 301 to the most similar item or the category/subcategory level page above it. Or, I&#8217;d leave the page up with a message that it&#8217;s no longer in stock, but here&#8217;s several items that are good substitutes. In the second case, it really becomes a landing page to drive search traffic that may still exist for the item to places where you can help satisfy those searchers.</p>
<h4></h4>
</li>
<li>
<h4>Do you have any suggestions on how category pages should be handled in relation to duplicate content and thin content?</h4>
<p>Google doesn&#8217;t worry too much about duplicate content on category pages &#8211; they expect that many of the words and photos are going to be similar to what&#8217;s found on product pages. The issue is when you have lots of versions of a single category page with little unique value to searchers. For example, having a category page for women&#8217;s pants is a good idea. Having 28 separate category pages for women&#8217;s pants where the only variations are size and color is probably not a great idea. In faceted navigation scenarios like that, I&#8217;d make the color and size filtered pages use a rel=canonical back to the non-faceted women&#8217;s pants page.</li>
<li>
<h4>What are some tips you can give online merchants looking to hire an SEO firm to handle their e-commerce website?</h4>
<p>I really like this short quiz Ian Lurie of Portent Interactive put together on <a href="http://www.portent.com/blog/seo/how-to-hire-an-seo-company-2012-edition.htm" target="_blank">How to Hire an SEO Company</a>. If you follow those guidelines, you&#8217;ll be in good shape. Just don&#8217;t be afraid to ask dumb questions and to follow up by asking &#8220;why&#8221; and &#8220;how do you know that&#8221; &#8211; SEOs aren&#8217;t following any mystical forms of knowledge and should be able to clearly explain why search engines work the way they do.</li>
<li>
<h4>Can you explain how Moz would help PrestaShop merchants?</h4>
<p>Moz has a ton of free resources to help learn about SEO and web marketing. I&#8217;d suggest checking out our <a href="http://moz.com/beginners-guide-to-seo" target="_blank">Beginner&#8217;s Guide to SEO</a>, our <a href="http://moz.com/learn/seo" target="_blank">Learn</a> page, and <a href="http://moz.com/blog/category/whiteboard-friday" target="_blank">Whiteboard Friday</a>.</p>
<p>As far as our software goes, it&#8217;s great for professional web marketers, so if you&#8217;re deep into the worlds of SEO, social media, and content marketing, definitely check it out. But if you&#8217;re planning to hire a marketer or a consultant, they&#8217;re probably the right folks to determine whether a <a href="http://moz.com/products/pro" target="_blank">Moz subscription</a> is right for you.</li>

<p><span id="more-17681"></span>Today we’re in Chelsea visiting a local store selling fresh and healthy yogurt. Unlike our previous merchants, John and his wife run a successful brick and mortar store. They recently decided to broaden their reach and by launching their online store, SOHHA. With tons of delicious pictures and a bit of uploading, their online store is live and almost ready for business.</p>

<p>Managing an online store that sells fresh products comes with its own set of challenges. We’re learning how he overcame them and seeing how ecommerce changed the way they do business.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Customer satisfaction should be a priority for all ecommerce merchants. After all, <a href="http://www.Bain.com" target="_blank">Bain &amp; Company</a> is attributed for the statistic, “It costs 6-7 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one.” However, the lack of customer complaints does not necessarily mean that customers are satisfied.</p>
<p>Unlike a definitive good or bad, customer satisfaction more resembles a continuum. As <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/today/post/article/20130604134550-284615-15-statistics-that-should-change-the-business-world-but-haven-t" target="_blank">1 Financial Training Services</a> shares, “96% of unhappy customers don’t complain. However, 91% of those will simply leave and never come back”. Have we convinced you to improve your customer service? If so, we’re helping you do just that with 7 proven ways to increase customer satisfaction for your online business.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17636" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/07/7-proven-ways-to-increase-customer-satisfaction.jpg" alt="" width="540" height="284" /></p>
<p><span id="more-17627"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #4c797e;">1. Surprise Customers with Freebies</span></h4>
<p>What is better than a freebie? A surprise freebie of course! Use the element of surprise to win customers over. Great examples for unexpected freebies? Try free shipping upgrades, complimentary samples, waived shipping fees, or even include swag (promotional items) in your packages. The best part about surprise freebies is that they can be implemented at your discretion. Once you run out of samples and swag, you simply stop giving them out. Check out this Tweet from a customer who received <a href="https://twitter.com/resanied/status/402845919109861376" target="_blank">PrestaShop Swag</a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17648" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/07/Prestashop-Twitter.png" alt="" width="418" height="541" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #4c797e;">2. “Under Promise, Over Deliver”</span></h4>
<p>This time-proven motto has served many large companies. What does it mean? Be aware of the promises you make to your customer, then aim to deliver more than what was promised. Why does it work? By following this motto, you consistently meet customer expectations. By repetitively delivering this level of service, you covert buyers into loyal customers. As an added bonus, you’ll save money because it costs less to <a href="http://spoken.typepad.com/.a/6a01157036a7d4970b0133f5309dc1970b-pi" target="_blank">retain customers</a>.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #4c797e;">3. Be Clear and Concise</span></h4>
<p>Avoid confusion by clearly outlining your products and service. An example? Ensure the checkout is clear and easy to use. Each Call to Action (CTA) button should lead customers to the next logical step in completing their purchase. Another example? Have a clear <a href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/234921" target="_blank">return policy</a>. Guidelines that are unique to your store should be repeated. Specifically, if you don’t accept returns for products that are opened – specify in the return policy <em>and</em> the product description.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #4c797e;">4. Anticipate Customer Needs</span></h4>
<p>This is one of <a href="http://corporate.ritzcarlton.com/en/About/GoldStandards.htm" target="_blank">Ritz Carlton’s</a> 3 steps in achieving the Gold Standard in customer service. It requires a deep and intimate understanding of your customers’ needs. Before a customer can think to raise a concern, address the issue. If someone is purchasing a gift, anticipate your customers’ needs by offering to send a packing list without prices. Addressing concerns before they become a concern keeps a customer happy because they were never unhappy to begin with.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #4c797e;">5. Empathize and be Sincere</span></h4>
<p>The late Maya Angelou once said, “[P]eople will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.” The best way to get customers to remember the way you made them feel is to provide customer service fueled with empathy and sincerity. Unfortunately, there is no set formula for achieving this. There are however, <a href="http://www.netpromotersystemblog.com/2014/02/24/intelligent-acts-of-kindness-why-it-pays-to-be-nice/" target="_blank">great examples of customer service done right</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite story tells how a, “desk clerk … delivered a pot of tea, gratis and unasked, to the room of a guest with a bad cold.” The customer probably can’t recall whether she had mint or honey tea, nor the desk clerk’s name. However, she will always remember the way she felt upon receiving that welcomed pot of hot tea. The sincerity behind the act is what made it stand out.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #4c797e;">6. Shorten Response Times</span></h4>
<p>In the age of social media, customers expect shorter response times. It may seem impossible to keep up if you are a one-man team. However, there are a few tips to quickly and efficiently address customer concerns. Start by creating customer service email templates. Here’s a sample:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear {Customer Name},</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We received your email in regards to {summary of their issue}. {If needed, sincerely apologize.} We will gladly resolve your {type of issue} issue by {what you’ll do or provide}. (If you are doing nothing, you must clearly state that. Be sure to provide a reason why.) Please {customers’ next step}.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for being a {positive adjective} customer. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact me at {contact information} with reference # {order number} as the subject line, or simply reply to this email.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>{Name}<br />
{Customer Service information}</p></blockquote>
<p>For issues that arise frequently, create specific emails templates for that issue. Also shorten response times by leveraging <a href="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/using-social-media-to-improve-customer-service-online-store/" target="_blank">social media as a customer service channel</a>. Monitor your social media accounts for comments and questions. Address them daily by quickly answering their question, sending them to a page with the answer, or providing the email address for customer service.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #4c797e;">7. Show Customers you Care</span></h4>
<p>As you update your site, convey the benefits of each change to customers. This is especially helpful for changes that may seem like a disadvantage for customers. Take for example, <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/matthewzeitlin/netflix-raises-prices-for-new-customers-current-customers-ke" target="_blank">Netflix</a>, an American video streaming company who increased the price of their monthly subscription. They sent emails that:</p>
<ol>
<li>thanked customers for using their service</li>
<li>provided value to customers by extending the current customer rate for 2 years.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the price increase is a still disadvantage for the customer, Netflix presented the issue in a positive light for customers. Netflix easily showed their customers they care by writing this email.</p>
<p>Are you doing your part in keeping customers satisfied? What works best? Share your methods in the comments below. If you don’t already have a method in place, which of these prevailing ways will you implement in your online store?</p>

<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center">“Multichannel is the way eCommerce should work in the 21st century. Get yourself on every possible platform starting from a web store and eBay up to Google Shopping and Facebook. But don’t even think about doing this manually &#8211; automate all the things.”</p>

<blockquote>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://bit.ly/WishTrend" target="_blank">WishTrend</a> is a Seoul based PrestaShop store and an international retailer for Korean beauty products. In a country brimming with cosmetics, only a few major brands ever gain global exposure. Eddie and Ryan, cofounders of this online store, aimed to share “Real Korean Beauty [products]” with the world. Since launching in late 2011, they shipped more than 60% of their 700+ products to international customers in the United States, Canada and Australia.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17497" style="color: #333333; font-style: normal; line-height: 24.375px; margin-top: 0.4em;" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/wish-trend-main.png" alt="" width="580" height="250" /></p>
<p>In 3 short years, this online store has successfully given 50+ local Korean beauty manufacturers international exposure. More impressively, they’ve maintained their tripling growth. Check out their success story and get inspired for yours!</p>
<p><span id="more-17495"></span></p>
<h4><span style="color: #8a2be2;">Why did you choose to open an online store?</span></h4>
<p>Korea has countless cosmetics brands with some of the greatest beauty manufacturers. Our goal is to link global consumers with underrepresented manufacturers from Korea’s cosmetics industry. We chose to open an online store because ecommerce is the easiest way to sell globally. We can communicate with our customers no matter where they are in the world. Also, we can easily update inventory and set up localized payment methods.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17499" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/youtube.png" alt="" width="380" height="307" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #8a2be2;">After your launch, what strategies did you use to drive traffic?</span></h4>
<p>First, we attempted to drive organic traffic by improving our SEO. With PrestaShop’s built in features, we easily added Meta titles, descriptions and tags then rewrote our URL’s. We then drove traffic with a strong social media presence on Facebook, YouTube, <a href="http://j.mp/PSWishTrendTwitter" target="_blank">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://j.mp/PSWishTrendPinterest" target="_blank">Pinterest</a>, and our “WishTrend Glam” blog. The most effective platforms are<a href="http://j.mp/PSWishTrendFacebook" target="_blank"> Facebook</a> (with over 61,000 likes), <a href="http://j.mp/PSWishTrendYoutube" target="_blank">YouTube</a> (with over 35,000 subscribers and 1 million views) and our blog, <a href="http://j.mp/PSWishTrendBlog" target="_blank">WishTrend Glam.</a> They all work together to increase qualified traffic to our website.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17496" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/REVIEWS.png" alt="" width="445" height="217" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #8a2be2;">Once customers land on your site, how did you convert them?</span></h4>
<p>We offer customers incentives to make purchases such as free shipping or $5 gift certificates. We then reassure visitors by displaying customer written product reviews on the home page. By leveraging both strategies, we quickly converted visitors into customers.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #8a2be2;">What about customer retention &#8211; how did you keep customers coming back?</span></h4>
<p>We send weekly newsletters to our members. In addition, we try to send customized messages to customers based on their purchase history, location and age group to provide personalized product suggestions. This extra effort helps us convert customers again and again.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-17498" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/YOTPO-REVIEWS.png" alt="" width="524" height="318" /></p>
<h4><span style="color: #8a2be2;">Do you use PrestaShop Modules? Which would you recommend?</span></h4>
<p>We currently use the basic <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/social-commerce-facebook-prestashop-modules/7366-yotpo-social-reviews.html" target="_blank">Yotpo module </a>for product reviews. With this module, customers receive an email 15 days after making a purchase asking them to leave a review for products in their order. As an incentive, customers are offered a discount coupon for a future order. We highly recommend this module to other PrestaShop merchants.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this day and age, selling on e-marketplaces has become relatively indispensable for small to large ecommerce business owners.</p>
<p>Building an online presence on European platforms such as eBay, Amazon, Rakuten, Zalando or la Redoute, just to name a few, can really <strong>give your business the boost it needs to grow</strong> and gain exposure to a large number of potential buyers.</p>
<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-17531" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/Image7.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="289" /></p>
<p><span id="more-17528"></span></p>
<h2><span style="color: #3366ff">Why sell on marketplaces</span></h2>
<p>The most obvious reason for choosing to sell on marketplaces is that every month, these websites <strong>attract millions of online shoppers</strong> &#8211; realistically speaking, a lot more than you will ever attract to your website. In 2013, Amazon reported <strong>237 million active buyers</strong> worldwide.</p>
<p>Therefore, it makes perfect sense to <strong>link your online store to key marketplaces</strong> and start <strong>reaping the benefits</strong>, which include:</p>
<p>- making your product available to customers in different demographics &#8211; <strong>international    exposure</strong><br />
- <strong>increased level of trust by the buyer</strong>, who is familiar with the marketplace and feels  safe<br />
- security and <strong>fraud protection</strong> offered by the major e-marketplaces<br />
- <strong>marketing benefits</strong>: eBay and Amazon spend millions in driving new customers to their  websites, as mentioned by <a href="http://www.is4profit.com/get-britain-growing/trading-online/how-to-sell-successfully-on-ebay.html" target="_blank">is4profit.</a></p>
<p>Emarketplaces charge a fee to be able to use their services. However, when calculating the cost of acquiring a new customer versus paying a marketplace fee &#8211; it is worth the investment. Learn how to calculate your <a href="http://blog.hubspot.com/ecommerce/calculating-ecommerce-cost-of-customer-acquisition" target="_blank">Cost of Customer Acquisition/ CoCA here</a>.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #3366ff">How to centralize your inventory</span></h2>
<p>If you have decided to sell or are already selling on multiple platforms, <strong>it is fundamental to have a system that will help you easily manage the availability of stock</strong> and gain visibility, across all channels. If, for example, a product sells out on eBay, as a store owner you should know &#8211; in real time &#8211; whether or not, that same product might be available on an another channel. Synchronisation of your inventory levels and order fulfillment, therefore, plays a major role.</p>
<p>Simply by installing a centralised system that will let you list, synchronise and distribute your stock across the various platforms, will allow you to streamline your operations, improve your overall inventory management and handle your entire sales cycle more effectively. One system to manage it all.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-17530 aligncenter" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/Marketplaces-image.jpg" alt="" width="619" height="245" /></p>
<h3><span style="color: #3366ff">Neteven &#8211; European Marketplace Management</span></h3>
<p>With over 8 years’ experience in working closely with the major marketplaces in Europe, Neteven has become the leading provider of Marketplace Management solutions.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-17529 aligncenter" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/logo-neteven.jpg" alt="" width="215" height="80" /></p>
<p>In order to make it simple for you to sell more efficiently, and <strong>distribute your catalogue across the major European platforms at a click of a mouse</strong>, a marketplace management module has been developed for PrestaShop users.</p>
<p>The module includes the following functionalities:</p>
<p>- Inventory management<br />
- Attributes and variations management<br />
- Bar codes publishing<br />
- Rich media product creation<br />
- Automated listing<br />
- Stock automation<br />
- Repricing<br />
- Optimization tools<br />
- End of transactions<br />
- Reporting tool</p>
<p>Synchronise your PrestaShop catalogue with Neteven and manage all your inventory from a single interface.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/marketplace-prestashop-modules/8091-neteven.html">Neteven module</a> is native in the software and it’s compatible with v.1.4.01 &#8211; v1.6.0.6. It is also available for download, free of charge, on <strong>PrestaShop’s Official Marketplace</strong>.</p>

			<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You started your online business to broaden your customer base. Because of this, you’re shipping orders all around the world, even to places you’ve never visited. All of this is very exciting but now you’re hearing terms like “localization”, “internationalization” and “multi-currency.” Do you know everything you need to know to run a business for your international customer base? Should you consider localizing and accepting payments in your customers’ local currency? We’re here to demystify and explain why you should and the best way to offer multiple currencies in your shopping cart!<br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17471" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/EN-Benefits-of-offering-your-products.jpg" alt="" width="580" height="248" /></p>
<p><span id="more-17470"></span>The importance of supporting multiple currencies is best explained with the pitfalls of single currency checkouts. Enabling only one currency for your shopping cart not only limits your customers to <strong>shop </strong>but also <strong>checkout </strong>using that currency. This could be a major deal breaker for a customer who can’t find their local currency.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">Pitfalls of single currency checkouts</span></h4>
<p>Limiting customers to shop in a foreign currency deters them from completing purchases and leads to cart abandonment and lost sales. According to <a href="http://www.statista.com/statistics/232285/reasons-for-online-shopping-cart-abandonment/" target="_blank">Statista</a>, 13% of online shoppers abandon a site when prices are presented in a foreign currency. . Additionally, once a customer makes a purchase in a foreign currency, their banks may impose foreign transaction fees; thus penalizing your customers for shopping on your online store.</p>
<h4><span style="color: #993300;">Offer Multiple Currencies with Authorize.Net</span></h4>
<p>That’s where <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/4154-authorizenet-aim.html" target="_blank">Authorize.Net</a> &#8211; a PrestaShop certified multiple-currency payment processor and a pioneering provider of ecommerce payment services &#8211; can help. Authorize.Net supports multiple currencies (USD, GBP, EUROS, AUD, CAD, NZD), so by using Authorize.Net and PrestaShop together, you may increase sales by allowing customers to shop and checkout in their local currency. Avoid chasing customers away with foreign bank fees and fluctuating exchange rates! Learn more by visiting PrestaShop Addons, and get started by downloading the Authorize.Net module.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17486" src="http://www.prestashop.com/blog/en/files/2014/06/147-1.png" alt="" width="220" height="127" /></p>
<p>In addition to accepting payments in multiple currencies, PrestaShop merchants using <a href="http://addons.prestashop.com/en/payments-gateways-prestashop-modules/4154-authorizenet-aim.html" target="_blank">Authorize.Net</a> also enjoy the following great benefits:</p>
